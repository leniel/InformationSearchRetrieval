The vectorial model was serialized using Python's Pickle module.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html

The serialized object was generated using the indexer module:

class indexer:

    def __init__(self, terms, docs, matrix):
        self.terms = terms
        self.documents = docs
        self.matrix = matrix

Where:

terms  = terms array [ the term at index 0 corresponds to the matrix row at index 0 ]
docs   = docs array [ doc at index 0 corresponds to matrix column at index 0 ]
matrix = vectorial model matrix [ lines maps to terms and columns maps to documents ]

Sample:

         doc 1  doc 2  doc 3
term 1   x      x      x
term 2   x      x      x
term 3   x      x      x

Each matrix cell has its weight calculated using TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency) numerical statistic.
