Leniel is very nice person. He usually goes walking to get the bus Circular 1 or 2 to get to UFRJ Technology Center at UFRJ. Walking is good for a healthy life. He likes to study because he thinks that studying is the only way to have a good job and earn some money. Life is beautiful and living is an art. :)
